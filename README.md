**Modern TypeScript rewrite of [express-flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-flash), allowing data such as error/success notifications to be temporarily stored in the session.**

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save modern-flash
# or
yarn install modern-flash
# or
pnpm install modern-flash
```

## Usage

The default export is `flash()`. This is an Express middleware method, and it must be mounted after mounting session middleware, such as [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) or [next-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-session). Specifically, when using next-session, make sure to install middleware that sets `req.session`.

Once mounted, request handlers will have a `flash()` function:

### Setting values in the flash store

Simply call `req.flash()` with two arguments. The first is a key to be used when inserting the value into the flashes object of the session. The second is either a string, or an array of strings.

If a key already exists with this name, the value(s) will be appended to the existing array.

```typescript
// Just one value:
req.flash("error", "The florpotron could not be configured. Please contact customer service.");

// Or multiple:
req.flash("error", [
	"Iâ€™m sorry, Dave. Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t do that.",
	"Unshrink you? That would require some sort of a rebigulator!"
]);

// How about another key:
req.flash("success", "Your order has been placed!");
```

### Getting all flashes from the store

Calling `req.flash()` with no arguments will return the entire flashes object from the session.

```typescript
let flashes = req.flash();
res.json(flashes);
```

The above sample would produce the following (prettified) output:

```json
{
	"error": [
		"The florpotron could not be configured. Please contact customer service.",
		"Iâ€™m sorry, Dave. Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t do that.",
		"Unshrink you? That would require some sort of a rebigulator!"
	],

	"success": [
		"Your order has been placed!"
	]
}
```

In addition, this will empty the flashes object in the session, as youâ€™re signalling that you have now sent these messages to the client, hence they are no longer needed.

If you donâ€™t care about the keys and just want the values, you can flatten them into a single array using [`Array.prototype.flat()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat):

```typescript
let flashes = Object.values(req.flash()).flat();
```

You might also find it useful to use destructuring syntax if you know exactly which keys youâ€™re interested in. However, keep in mind that all flashes will still be cleared from the session.

```typescript
let { error, somethingElse } = req.flash();
```

### Getting specific flash keys from the store

As `req.flash()` with no arguments will clear the entire store, you may find it useful to only retrieve specific keys youâ€™re interested in.

```typescript
let errors = req.flash("error");
```

Calling this method will remove the specified key from the store.

### Getting the flashes within templating engines

A `flashes` property is added to the `res.locals` object, for convenience with templating engines that pass this through to your templates.

Accessing the `res.locals.flashes` property is equivalent to calling `req.flash()` â€“ that is, you will clear the flash store by doing so. However, unlike `req.flash()`, once accessed once, subsequent accesses will return a cached value. This allows you to somewhat simplify your templating logic.

Hereâ€™s an example of how it could be used from a Pug template:

```pug
if Object.keys(flashes).length > 0
	.alert(role="alert")
		for items in Object.values(flashes)
			for message in items
				p= message
```

Note that `res.locals.flashes` is read-only. Changes made to this object will not have any effect on the flashes object in the session.

### Complete example

```typescript
import express from "express";
import session from "express-session";
import flash from "modern-flash";

const app = express();

// Set up a session. With express-session:
app.use(session({
	// Session config goes here
}));

// â€¦or with next-session:
let getSession = nextSession({
	// Session config goes here
});

// Let modern-flash set itself up in the session:
app.use(flash());

// An example of how you could use it:
app.get("/", async (req, res, next) => {
	// If you use next-session, set the session object before accessing flash():
	req.session = await getSession(req, res);

	let error = req.flash("error");

	// Pretend youâ€™re using a more elaborate templating system than this.
	// This is just for demonstration ðŸ™‚
	res.set("Content-Type", "text/html");
	res.end(`
		${error ? `<p>Error: ${error}</p>` : ""}
		<form action="" method="post">
			<button type="submit">Do something</button>
		</form>
	`);
});

app.post("/", (req, res, next) => {
	// Do some hardcore processing magic hereâ€¦
	// â€¦
	// Oops, something went wrong! Letâ€™s tell the user:
	req.flash("error", "The florpotron could not be configured. Please contact customer service.");
	res.redirect("/");
});

app.listen(3000);
```
